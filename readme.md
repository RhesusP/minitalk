</div>

Sixth project for [42 school](https://42.fr/en/homepage/). The aim is to create a client and a server that can communicate only using UNIX signals.

## Subject

The communication between client and server has to be done only using SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals.

Server must:
- be started first 
- print its PID
- print the string after fully receiving
- be able to receive strings from several clients in a row without needing to restart.

## Usage

#### Server

```bash
./server
```

#### Client

```bash
./client [server_pid] [message]
```

## How does it work ?
